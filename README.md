memory
======

A fun little ruby-on-rails app that utilizes a Ravelry json feed to create a memory game.

Selecting cards will turn them over; get a match, and you'll see it appear in your matches pane! 
Don't get a match, and they'll flip over for you to try again! It's just like the game you
remember from your childhood, but involving more knitting. :-)
